# Current status of infections

{% include infections_embed.html %}
This shows the number of confirmed infections reported by the Johns Hopkins University [Center for Systems Science and Engineering (JHU CSSE)](https://systems.jhu.edu/) for a few countries I thought interesting. They have some [great visualizations](https://www.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6), you should check it out. Data comes from their [github repo](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19) and is updated every day.

# Extrapolations of cumulative infections for various countries

I took the observed number of confirmed COVID-19 cases created a model that uses [logistic function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_function) to predict future cases. This is a sigmoid shape and so allows for exponential growth that slowly flattens out. The data predictions come from a [Markov chain Monte Carlo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamiltonian_Monte_Carlo) analysis with priors that prevent the number of infections from being larger than the total population of the country. Also, it probably shouldn't be taken seriously by anyone.

The figures below are auto-generated using data on the latest number of confirmed cases and extrapolate from the observations by 50 days. The peak infection rate is the last day where the number of daily cases increases and the total number of infections is over the entire epidemic. The uncertainty regions are 80% confidence intervals.

# Thanks (i.e. who I took ideas and code from)
I got the idea for this site from a [reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/ff9jn4/oc_number_of_cases_per_country_counting_from_the/) and the [Github repo](https://github.com/JeroenKools/covid19) of [Jeroen Kools](https://github.com/JeroenKools).

The data all comes from the JHU CSSE [Github repo](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19) and is updated every day.

I also stole a bunch of the code from [Ethan Kruse's Github repo](https://github.com/ethankruse/exoplots), which is a fork of one from [Elisa Quintana](https://github.com/elisaquintana/exoplots), where he worked out how to make Bokeh and Github Pages play nicely together.

The site is built with Github Pages, Bokeh, PyMC3, and other code.
